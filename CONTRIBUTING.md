## How to contribute

*WIP*

## Communication

GitHub issues are the primary way for communicating about specific proposed changes to this project.
Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests.

You may also contact the maintainers by e-mail for more specific purposes and questions.

In both contexts, please be kind and courteous. 
Language issues are often contentious and we'd like to keep discussion brief, civil and focused on what we're actually doing, not wandering off into too much imaginary stuff. 
Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behaviour is not welcome.
